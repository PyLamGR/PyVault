Python Password Generator


This password generator was built by PyLam. It comes with both a terminal and graphical user interface version. The user gives a number that represents the strength of the password they want, then the number of arithmetic digits is given(if the user does not want numbers in password he enters 0 to digits), then a few more password attributes are selected and the password can be generated. This generator also comes with history of all the passwords generated by the user and if needed it can be cleared.
